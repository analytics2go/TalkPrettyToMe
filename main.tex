\paragraph{Relationships and Data Structure}

\section*{Entities}
\subsubsection{Design}
The system is organized by Reservations. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Reservation has a unique identifier, description name, room identifier, person who requested the reservation, service rating and the date and time for request. The creation date and creation time of the reservation is tracked. \item A reservation can be associated with any room for a specific time period.
\item A room is associated with only one active reservation for a finite time period.
\item A room has a description name, room category and room status.
\item The database will store each registered user's full name, password, email, city and state.
\item A user is identified by a unique identifier and user email.
\item A User can be of type of Admin or Normal exclusively.
\item User of type Admin can manage entire system, can access all data and run reports.
\item User of type Normal does not have any privileges of user type Admin.
\item User types of Admin and Normal can register as users, book a reservation, modify a reservation, cancel a reservation and view status of reservations.
\item User of type Normal can send messages to user of type Admin.
\item User of type Normal can rate service and quality of a reservation.
\end{itemize}

Based on the system design requirements, the following entity types are in the Reservation database:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reservation,  Reservation Service Rating
    \item Room, Room Category, Room Status
    \item Person, User, User Category
\end{itemize}
